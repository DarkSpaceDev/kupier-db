This is an implementation of a loosely-relational document database that has ACID transactions. This falls under the categorization of NewSQL which is a partial hybrid of old sql and newer document databases in stylistic implementation details. You could consider this a 'rusty' implementation of a database where all the ideas are built from existing but combined in a way that makes it more usful than traditional sql or nosql alone can.
